		<h2 id="first">A History of Accomplishments</h2>
		<h3>Timeline</h3>
	</div>

	<p>For nearly half a century, the Union of Concerned Scientists has combined the knowledge and influence of the scientific community with the passion of concerned citizens to build a healthy planet and a safer world. Here are just a few of the results that powerful combination has delivered so far:</p>

	<div>
		<h3>UCS Accomplishments 2010 – Present</h3>
	</div>

	<ul>
		<li>UCS plays a key role in passing landmark emissions and fuel efficiency standards that will cut in half the global warming emissions of new cars and light trucks by 2025. All told, the changes will be equivalent to taking some 40 million of today’s cars and trucks off the road. <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_vehicles/">Read More Here</a></li>
		<li>UCS helps convince California to require that at least one-third of its electricity comes from clean, renewable sources by 2020, setting an inspiring precedent for the nation. <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/">Read More Here</a></li>
		<li>The result of years of analysis and advocacy, UCS helps win international protections for rainforests that will keep at least 300 million tons of global warming emissions from the atmosphere each year, an outcome  equivalent to shutting down more than 60 dirty, coal-fired plants. <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/global_warming/solutions/stop-deforestation/">Read More Here</a></li>
		<li>After years of effort, UCS wins a victory in Congress with the unanimous passage of a bill that explicitly affords whistleblower protection to scientists and others who expose the distortion or suppression of federal scientific data. <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/node/372">Read More Here</a></li>
		<li>UCS’s report, Ripe for Retirement, the first study of its kind, identifies 353 coal-fired power plants across the country as prime candidates for closure due to their inability to compete with modern, cleaner alternatives. Within a year of the report’s release in 2012, 20 percent of the coal generators named announce plans to close or convert to natural gas, an outcome that will reduce U.S. annual carbon emissions by more than 100 million tons. <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/">Read More Here</a></li>
		<li>A UCS analysis exposes News Corp for extremely misleading climate coverage, showing that Fox News Channel and the Wall Street Journal’s opinion page mislead on climate science more than 80 percent of the time. <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/global_warming/">Read More Here</a></li>
		<li>UCS introduces a plan to cut projected U.S. oil consumption in half within the next 20 years. Through improved efficiency, low-carbon biofuels, vehicle electrification, and better transportation choices, the organization’s visionary Half the Oil Plan would halve projected U.S. oil use by 2030. <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/clean-vehicles/">Read More Here</a></li>
		<li>A UCS team publishes the award-winning book, Cooler Smarter: Practical Steps to Low-Carbon Living, challenging all Americans to cut their global warming emissions by 20 percent within a year and giving them the information needed to get the job done. The book has inspired thousands of readers to reduce their carbon emissions, was featured by more than 100 news outlets, and won “best science book of the year” at the Green Book Festival. <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/global_warming/">Read More Here</a></li>
		<li>UCS launches the Center for Science and Democracy, an ambitious initiative dedicated to strengthening the American democracy by restoring the essential role of science, evidence-based decision making, and constructive debate as a means to improve the health, security, and prosperity of all Americans. <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/center-for-science-and-democracy/">Read More Here</a></li>
		<li>Determining that demand for palm oil was one of the major drivers of tropical deforestation, UCS’s mounts a well-timed campaign that succeeds in pressuring major companies including Wilmar, the world’s largest palm oil trader, Colgate-Palmolive, General Mills, and Hershey’s to commit to sourcing palm oil that is deforestation-free. <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/global_warming/solutions/stop-deforestation/">Read More Here</a></li>
		<li>UCS helps push the U.S. Senate to approve the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) to reduce U.S. and Russian nuclear weapons stockpiles. These reductions cut down both countries’ oversized nuclear arsenals—a dangerous legacy of the Cold War—while allowing the U.S. military to preserve a flex­ible strategic deterrent. <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/global_warming/solutions/stop-deforestation/">Read More Here</a></li>

		<h3>Where Does UCS Funding Come From?</h3>

	<p>See the <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/node/5326">Online Annual Report.</a></br>The generosity of our members and foundation partners enabled UCS to maintain financial stability in the last fiscal year, with an operating budget of more than $25 million. This generous support is critical to our ability to maintain an independent voice. That is why we are proud of the fact that 84 percent of your donations go directly to funding Union of Concerned Scientists program work. Your support enables us to continue developing science-based solutions to some of the most far-reaching environmental and security issues of our time.</p>

	<p>More than 94,000 UCS members contributed 82 percent of our total operating income. We are grateful for this funding as it is a strong vote of confidence and for the trust both our longtime supporters and newest members have placed in our unique ability to bring the power of independent science to bear on some of the most pressing issues of the day. Support from foundations represented 15 percent of our FY2014 operating budget and provided crucial support throughout our program areas.</p>

	<div>
		<h3>Union of Concerned Scientists 2014 Expenses</h3>
	</div>

	<p>We are proud that 84 percent of our FY2014 expenses supported our direct program work, including our scientific and technical analysis. Careful management helped us limit administrative costs and fund-raising expenses to 16 percent of our total expenditures. We take pride in the fact that UCS continues to allocate as many resources as possible to our critical program work.</p>
