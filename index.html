		<h2>President Obama, India’s Prime Minister Modi, and the Opportunity to Cooperate on Climate Change</h2>
		<p>When I was growing up in New Delhi, the annual Republic Day celebrations were always cause for great national pride. They commemorate the day this large, vibrant democracy’s constitution came into force, after India secured its independence from British colonial rule. This year President Obama will be a special guest for the Republic Day parade, a spectacular display of India’s rich cultural heritage and military might. What I am keenly interested to hear are the ways in which Prime Minister Modi and President Obama plan to cooperate to address one of the biggest challenges facing the world today: climate change.</p>

		<h2>The Latest on Biofuels and Land Use: Progress to Report, but Challenges Remain</h2>
		<p>Carbon pollution caused indirectly by the increasing use of crops to produce biofuels has been a contentious topic for the last 7 years. In this post I look back at what we have learned since then about indirect land use change (ILUC) emissions, as this phenomena is generally called.

		<h2>TEPCO’s Fukushima Folly: Fission Stories #180</h2>
		<p>TEPCO is essentially painting pictures using very few dots with no numbers. They keep running computer studies that put numbers almost randomly on the few dots they have to see what picture emerges. “Lo and behold” to quote a professor I had in college, different pictures emerge. TEPCO fills in these information gaps with guesses. And they keep revising their results because they keep revising their guesses.</p>

		<h2>Renewable Generators Would Provide Millions in Local Tax Revenue and Payments to Rural Communities, While Keeping Rates Affordable</h2>
		<p>Strengthening Minnesota’s renewable electricity standard to require that 40 percent of the state’s electricity comes from renewable sources, such as wind and solar, by 2030 would drive billions in new investment in clean energy generation in Minnesota at little additional cost to consumers, according to a study released today by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS). Minnesota’s current standard is 25 percent by 2025.</p>
