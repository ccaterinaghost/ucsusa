		<h3>What's at Stake</h3>
	</div>
	
	<h4>Power generation is a leading cause of air pollution and the single largest source of U.S. global warming emissions.</h4>
	<p>Coal is the worst offender, a dirty energy source that produces less than half our electricity but nearly 80 percent of all power plant carbon emissions.</p>
	<h4>The good news is that coal is on the decline.</h4>
	<p>Many old and inefficient coal plants are closing down and essentially no new coal plants are being built in the U.S., a trend that is driving the largest transformation of the U.S. electricity system in half a century. The energy choices we make during this pivotal moment will have huge consequences for our health, our climate, and our economy for decades to come. Right now we are moving toward a natural gas-dominated electricity system, but an over-reliance on natural gas has significant risks and is not a long-term solution to our energy needs. Like coal, it is a fossil fuel that generates substantial global warming emissions, and has other health, environmental, and economic risks.</p>
	<h4>There's a better, cleaner way to meet our energy needs.</h4>
	<p>Renewable energy resources like wind and solar power generate electricity with little or no pollution and global warming emissions—and could reliably and affordably provide up to 40 percent of U.S. electricity by 2030, and 80 percent by 2050.</p>
	<p>To create a cleaner, safer, and healthier energy future, it's time to choose renewables first.</p>

	<div>
		<h3>Our Energy Choices</h3>
	</div>

	<h4>Renewable energy: Unlimited resources. Nearly zero pollution.</h4>
	<p>Renewable energy generates electricity from sustainable sources like wind, solar, and geothermal power with little or no pollution or global warming emissions. Learn more about <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/node/4523">renewable energy technologies.</a></p>
	<h4>Coal, natural gas, and oil: Dirty sources of energy</h4>
	<p>Fossil fuels—coal, natural gas, and oil—produce most of our electricity but come with significant and harmful consequences. They produce the vast majority of global warming emissions. They release toxic chemicals that pollute our air and water. And they have adverse, and costly, effects on public health. Learn more about <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/node/4524">coal and other fossil fuels</a></p>
	<h4>Nuclear power: Risky energy</h4>
	<p>Nuclear power plants produce no air pollution or global warming emissions when they operate but can cause catastrophic damage to human health and the environment in the event of a meltdown or other disaster, as evidenced by the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan. Learn more about <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/node/3633">nuclear power</a></p>
	<h4>Energy and water use</h4>
	<p>Conventional power plants place heavy demands on our water resources—coal power consumes the most, but natural gas and nuclear power also require significant amounts. In places where energy production requires a large share of available water, the energy-water connection can turn into a collision—with dangerous implications for both. Learn more about <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/node/4525">water-smart energy choices</a></p>

	<div>
		<h3>Smart Energy Solutions</h3>
	</div>

	<p>We need smart energy solutions that provide reliable and affordable electricity, contribute to a strong economy, and do not compromise our health or our climate. No single energy technology can accomplish all of this. </br>The answer lies instead in a diverse energy strategy that offers the greatest potential to move the country toward a clean, sustainable energy future.</p>
	<h4>Increase renewable energy</h4>
	<p>Renewable energy is reliable, affordable, and beneficial for our health, our economy, and our climate. UCS supports practical, cost-effective policies that promote renewable energy and lower barriers to its adoption. </br>These include strong renewable electricity standards, financial incentives like clean energy tax credits, and investment in a smarter electrical grid. Learn more about how we can <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/node/4526">increase renewable energy</a></p>
	<h4>Decrease coal use</h4>
	<p>Coal is our dirtiest source of energy. It releases more harmful pollutants into the atmosphere than any other energy source and produces a quarter of the nation’s global warming emissions. If we are going to effectively reduce air pollution and address global warming, we need to shut down the oldest, dirtiest coal plants—and not build new ones to replace them. Learn more about <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/node/4527">decreasing our coal use</a></p>
	<h4>Improve energy efficiency</h4>
	<p>If we use energy more efficiently, we need less of it in the first place. Improving the efficiency of our power generation—along with increased efficiency in buildings, appliances, and electronic devices—can create significant energy savings that would allow us to safely and reliably shut down old, dirty power plants.

		<h3>What's at Stake</h3>
	</div>

	<h4>We can reduce our oil use.</h4>
	<p>Scientists, engineers, and analysts have constructed a plan—Half the Oil—to cut U.S. oil use. Through smart policies and practices—including increased fuel efficiency, better biofuels, and advanced electric cars—we can realize the benefits of using less oil.</p>
	<h4>Progress is already being made.</h4>
	<p>Fuel economy standards have made cars and trucks more efficient. Electric vehicles are becoming more widespread. And scientists are finding new ways to make our fuels cleaner—but more can be done.</p>
	<h4>Using less oil offers huge benefits.</h4>
	<p>Cleaner transportation options will help create jobs, save money, and reduce global warming pollution.</p>
	<h4>Drilling for more oil isn’t the answer.</h4>
	<p>Oil is as expensive and dangerous as ever before, and it’s the largest single source of U.S. carbon emissions. We can do better.</p>
	<h4>We can Half the Oil.</h4>
	<p>The United States can be a transportation leader. We have the technology, and we’ve seen the benefits: <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_vehicles/what_you_can_do/">now we need action.</a></p>

	<div>
		<h3>Why Clean Cars?</h3>
	</div>

	<p>America consumes more than 19 million barrels of oil every day. We burn most of it for transportation. This prodigious oil use comes with significant costs to our climate, our health, and our pocketbooks—but clean vehicles can help.</p>
	<h4>Oil drives global warming</h4>
	<p>Our cars, trucks, airplanes, and ships account for nearly 30 percent of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions and more than 5 percent of the world’s total global warming pollution. This pollution directly contributes to sea level rise, more frequent and intense heat waves, and other costly impacts. Learn more about <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_vehicles/why-clean-cars/global-warming/">cars and global warming</a></p>
	<h4>It’s not just CO2: oil creates air pollution</h4>
	<p>Transportation is one of the U.S.’s largest sources of air pollution. In 2013, transportation contributed more than half of the carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides, and almost a quarter of the hydrocarbons emitted into our air. All this pollution has serious implications for public health, including increased incidences of respiratory ailments like asthma and bronchitis. Learn more about <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_vehicles/why-clean-cars/air-pollution-and-health/">air pollution and public health</a></p>
	<h4>Oil is expensive</h4>
	<p>A typical American driver spends almost as much on gas as they do on purchasing their vehicle. Collectively, we spend around 2 billion dollars on oil and petroleum products per day. Drilling more isn’t the answer, either: so-called “new oil” is just as dirty, dangerous, and expensive as ever before. The real solution is to use less oil.</p>

	<div>
		<h3>Smart Solutions</h3>
	</div>

	<p>With the right policies, practices, and investments, we can make the United States a transportation leader—and cut projected U.S. oil use in half.</p>
	<h4>Increase fuel efficiency</h4>
	<p>Improving the fuel economy of our nation’s vehicles offers the single greatest opportunity for reducing oil consumption—and federal policy provides the most powerful tool for accomplishing it. Learn more about <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_vehicles/smart-transportation-solutions/better-fuel-efficiency/">improving U.S. fuel economy</a></p>
	<h4>Produce better biofuels</h4>
	<p>Corn-based ethanol currently dominates the U.S. market, but cleaner options are available, including cellulosic fuels made from wood and grass. Investing in these and other non-food based biofuels could drastically reduce U.S. oil use. Learn more about <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_vehicles/smart-transportation-solutions/cleaner_fuels/">better biofuels</a></p>
	<h4>Drive advanced vehicles</h4>
	<p>Hybrid, electric, and fuel-cell technologies are increasingly common and affordable, and offer long-term solutions for U.S. oil consumption. Learn more about <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_vehicles/smart-transportation-solutions/advanced-vehicle-technologies/">electric cars and trucks</a></p>
	<h4>We can Half the Oil</h4>
	<p>Progress has been made, including landmark federal fuel standards and forward-thinking state-level legislation. Experts and entrepreneurs are helping too. Still, more needs doing—and you can help. Learn more about <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_vehicles/smart-transportation-solutions/vehicle-policy/current-policies-and-legislation/half-the-oil-how-it-works.html">how Half the Oil works</a></p>

		<h2 id="third">Food & Agriculture</h2>
		<h3>What's at Stake</h3>
	</div>
	
	<h4>Our food system is broken—but science can help fix it.</h4>
	<p>The U.S. government spends billions of dollars each year to subsidize crops used to produce processed foods and sugary drinks—the same foods the USDA’s nutritional guidelines tell us to eat less of. </br>This policy failure is contributing to a massive and costly public health crisis, as rates of chronic, diet-related diseases like diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease have shot up—even, increasingly, among children. </br>And the same policies that encourage unhealthy food production also support an outdated, unsustainable system of industrial agriculture, which has damaging impacts on soil, air, water, human health, and rural economies.</p>
	<h4>There’s a better way.</h4>
	<p>Smart, science-based food and farm policies can increase every American’s access to fresh fruits and vegetables, saving thousands of lives and billions of health care dollars in the process. </br>And by encouraging farmers to grow a diverse mix of foods using modern, sustainable methods, healthy food policies will also help keep U.S. agriculture productive for the long term. </br>With powerful interests defending current policies, transforming our food system in a healthier direction will not be easy. But we can do it—and our future depends on it.</p>

	<div>
		<h3>Our Failing Food System</h3>
	</div>

	<p>Agriculture in the United States has taken the wrong road, and it isn't working. The wealthiest nation in the world is feeding its citizens an unhealthy diet—and growing most of this food using unsustainable methods. The results? A population threatened by a crisis of diet-related chronic illness; millions of acres of damaged farmland; chemical runoff spilling into our waterways. Our food system, for all its vaunted productivity, is failing us.</p>
	<h4>Unhealthy food policy</h4>
	<p>U.S. food policy should work to ensure a plentiful supply of healthy food for the nation. But the current system of agricultural subsidies mostly benefits large-scale growers of commodity crops such as corn and soybeans. Our diet is dominated by processed foods made from these subsidized crops, and a growing body of research connects this diet to increases in obesity and the diseases that go with it. </br>The solution? We need to eat more fruits and vegetables—and therefore, we need policies that encourage farmers to grow them. But Big Ag benefits from the status quo and is fighting to protect it. Learn more about <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/node/4684">unhealthy food policy</a></p>
	<h4>Industrial agriculture</h4>
	<p>The late 20th century saw a major transformation in U.S. agriculture. Farms grew to enormous sizes, becoming focused on a few commodity crops and increasingly dependent on synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. And meat production became dominated by large CAFOs (confined animal feeding operations). </br>These methods of producing food leave a host of problems in their wake. Runoff from chemical inputs and CAFO waste pollutes our water and contributes to global warming; monoculture—planting a single crop over a large area year after year—depletes soil and reduces biodiversity; overuse of antibiotics in meat production threatens our ability to fight human disease. Learn more about <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/node/4685">industrial agriculture</a></p>
	<h4>Genetic engineering in agriculture</h4>
	<p>Genetic engineering (GE) has become a key component of industrial agriculture. GE technology offers potential benefits, along with risks that current regulations have not addressed effectively. So far, GE solutions to food production problems haven't performed well in real-world applications, especially in comparison with less costly crop breeding and sustainable farming methods. Learn more about <a  href="http://www.ucsusa.org/node/4686">genetic engineering</a></p>

	<div>
		<h3>Healthy Food and Farm Solutions</h3>
	</div>

	<p>The good news is that we know how to fix our food system. Science-based sustainable farming methods can (and do) produce abundant food without the pitfalls of industrial agriculture. Local and regional food systems can help make fresh, healthy food available to everyone. And forward-looking policies can help these innovative practices grow and prosper. Here's what we need to do make healthy food and farm solutions take root:</p>
	<h4>Expand healthy food access</h4>
	<p>We know Americans need to eat healthier food—and that starts with producing more of it. But growing healthy food using sustainable methods is only half the equation. We also need to make sure that this food is available and affordable—especially in lower-income communities, which are disproportionately affected by the health impacts of the industrial food system. Local and regional food systems, school food programs, food equity initiatives, and other innovative approaches can help ensure that all Americans have access to the fruits of farmers' labor. Learn more about <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/node/4688">expanding healthy food access</a></p>
	<h4>Advance sustainable agriculture</h4>
	<p>The farmers of the future will use sustainable practices that get the most out of the land while preserving and improving the health of soil, water, and local ecosystems. </br>And the future, increasingly, is now. Growing numbers of American farmers are using sustainable practices to grow healthy foods—and thriving businesses. But in a food system geared to serve the needs of industrial agriculture, these farmers often face an uphill battle. Learn more about <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/node/4687">advancing sustainable agriculture</a></p>
	<h4>Strengthen healthy farm policy</h4>
	<p>Farm policy has become part of the problem—subsidizing the wrong foods, steering research dollars toward industrial agriculture, and creating roadblocks for farmers who grow fruits and vegetables or use sustainable practices. </br>But it doesn't have to be that way. Policy solutions that will help farmers feed a healthy America are on the table, and UCS is helping to win them the support they need to become reality. Learn more about <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/node/4689">healthy farm policy</a></p>

		<h2 id="fourth">Global Warming</h2>
		<h3>What's at Stake</h3>
	</div>
	
	<h4>Global warming is already having significant and harmful effects on our communities, our health, and our climate.</h4>
	<p>Sea level rise is accelerating. The number of large wildfires is growing. Dangerous heat waves are becoming more common. Extreme storm events are increasing in many areas. More severe droughts are occurring in others.</p>
	<p>We must take immediate action to address global warming or these consequences will continue to intensify, grow ever more costly, and increasingly affect the entire planet—including you, your community, and your family.</p>
	<p>The good news is that we have the practical solutions at hand to dramatically reduce our carbon emissions, slow the pace of global warming, and pass on a healthier, safer world to future generations. With your help, we can accomplish it.</p>
	<h4>Together, we can tackle global warming.</h4>

	<div>
		<h3>Science</h3>
	</div>
	
	<h4>Global warming is happening now.</h4>
	<p>The planet's temperature is rising. The trend is clear and unmistakable. </br>Every one of the past 37 years has been warmer than the 20th century average. The 12 warmest years on record have all occurred since 1998. The hottest year ever recorded for the contiguous United States occurred in 2012. </br>Globally, the average surface temperature has increased more than one degree Fahrenheit since the late 1800s. Most of that increase has occurred over just the past three decades.</p>
	<h4>We are the cause.</h4>
	<p>We are overloading our atmosphere with carbon dioxide, which traps heat and steadily drives up the planet’s temperature. Where does all this carbon come from? The fossil fuels we burn for energy—coal, natural gas, and oil—plus the loss of forests due to deforestation, especially in the tropics.</p>
	<h4>The scientific evidence is clear.</h4>
	<p>Within the scientific community, there is no debate. An overwhelming majority of climate scientists agree that global warming is happening and that human activity is the primary cause. Learn more about <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/node/4507">global warming science</a></p>

	<div>
		<h3>Impacts</h3>
	</div>

	<p>Global warming is already having significant and costly effects – and these consequences will only intensify as the planet’s temperature continues to rise.</p>
	<h4>Accelerating Sea Level Rise</h4>
	<p>Global warming is accelerating the rate of sea level rise and dramatically increasing coastal flooding risks, especially on the U.S. East Coast and Gulf of Mexico.</p>
	<h4>Longer and More Damaging Wildfire Seasons</h4>
	<p>Wildfires are increasing and wildfire season is getting longer in the Western U.S. as temperatures rise.</p>
	<h4>More Frequent and Intense Heat Waves</h4>
	<p>Dangerously hot weather is already occurring more frequently than it did 60 years ago.</p>
	<h4>Costly and Growing Health Impacts</h4>
	<p>Climate change has significant implications for our health, including increased air pollutio and a longer and more intense allergy season.</p>
	<h4>Heavier Precipitation and Flooding</h4>
	<p>As temperatures increase, more rain falls during the heaviest downpours, increasing the risk of flooding events. Learn more about <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/node/4508">global warming impacts</a></p>

	<div>
		<h3>Solutions</h3>
	</div>
	
	<h4>Reduce emissions</h4>
	<p>We must significantly reduce the heat-trapping emissions we are putting into the atmosphere. As individuals, we can help by taking action to reduce our personal carbon emissions. But to fully address the threat of global warming, we must demand action from our elected leaders. Learn more about <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/node/4509">reducing global warming emissions</a></p>
	<h4>Stop deforestation</h4>
	<p>Tropical deforestation accounts for about 10 percent of the world’s heat-trapping emissions. Reducing tropical deforestation can significantly lower global warming emissions and plays an integral role in a comprehensive long-term solution to global warming. Learn more about <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/node/4510">stopping deforestation</a></p>
	<h4>Fight misinformation</h4>
	<p>Why has it been so difficult to achieve meaningful solutions to global warming? Media pundits, partisan think tanks, and special interest groups raise doubts about the truth of global warming. This barrage of misinformation misleads and confuses the public — and makes it more difficult to implement effective solutions. Learn more about <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/node/4511">fighting misinformation</a></p>
	<h4>Prepare for impacts</h4>
	<p>Certain consequences of global warming are now inevitable, including sea level rise, more frequent and severe heat waves, and growing wildfire risks. Even as we work to reduce global warming emissions, we must also prepare for this dangerous new reality.

		<h2 id="fifth">Nuclear Power</h2>
		<h3>What's at Stake</h3>
	</div>

	<p>The Fukushima disaster of 2011 showed what can happen when a nuclear power plant's safety systems fail. The U.S. nuclear industry has responded with familiar reassurances that it can't happen here. </br>We know better. Nuclear accidents can happen here—but they don't have to. </br>Enforcing fire and earthquake regulations, addressing flood risks, and safer storage for nuclear waste are just a few of the ways we can help prevent nuclear accidents.</p>
	<h4>The United States should take these steps now</h4>
	<p>Upgrading safety and security standards, enforcing all the rules, and becoming the tough, consistent regulator the public deserves.</p>
	<h4>You can help.</h4>
	<p>Check out our <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/take-action/nuclear-power-activism">action alerts</a>, visit our citizen resource center, and speak up for better-regulated nuclear power in the United States. Together we can make this low-carbon energy source as safe as possible.</p>

	<div>
		<h3>Safety Issues</h3>
	</div>

	<p>While the probability of a nuclear power accident may be small, the human and environmental consequences of a radiation release can be catastrophic.</p>
	<h4>Nuclear accidents happen</h4>
	<p>Floods, fires, and earthquakes can combine with aging facilities and error-prone humans in devastating ways. Adequate understanding of these issues, along with significant safety upgrades and consistent oversight, can help safeguard the U.S. public. Learn more about <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear_power/making-nuclear-power-safer/preventing-nuclear-accidents/">preventing nuclear accidents</a></p>
	<h4>Waste should be safely stored</h4>
	<p>Nuclear fuel emits radiation long after it’s done powering a reactor. Securing a long-term waste repository—and transferring fuel currently held in cooling pools to dry casks—is essential for long-term public safety. Learn more about <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear_power/making-nuclear-power-safer/handling-nuclear-waste/">handling nuclear waste</a></p>
	<h4>Security matters</h4>
	<p>Reactors and waste storage facilities make inviting targets for terrorists—but adopting robust security measures could help prevent an attack. Learn more about <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear_power/making-nuclear-power-safer/keeping-nuclear-plants-secure/">nuclear power security</a></p>
	<h4>The NRC must do more</h4>
	<p>The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is charged with regulating commercial nuclear power in the United States. UCS has been advocating for better NRC enforcement of safety regulations for decades—but more must be done to make nuclear power safer. Learn more about the <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear_power/making-nuclear-power-safer/who-is-responsible/">NRC and other safety actors</a></p>

	<div>
		<h3>Technology</h3>
	</div>
	
	<h4>Boiling water with fission</h4>
	<p>The basic principle behind a nuclear reactor is simple: the heat produced by a controlled nuclear reaction is used to create steam pressure that drives a power-generating turbine. </br>But the technology required to implement this principle efficiently and safely is enormously complex. The fission chain reaction must be maintained at the correct rate and quickly adjusted or stopped when necessary. Water temperature and pressure must be carefully controlled. And elaborate, redundant cooling systems are needed to prevent nuclear fuel from overheating, which can lead to a meltdown. Learn more about <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear_power/nuclear_power_technology/how-nuclear-power-works.html">how nuclear power works</a></p>
	<h4>PWR vs BWR</h4>
	<p>Different reactor designs approach these requirements in different ways. About two-thirds of operating U.S. reactors are pressurized water reactors (PWRs); the rest are boiling water reactors (BWRs). Both BWRs and PWRs heat ordinary water with nuclear fuel, driving turbines that generate power.</p>
	<h4>New designs</h4>
	<p>Several new reactor designs have been proposed in the United States and elsewhere. These include “small modular reactors” which proponents claim are safer and more cost-effective, but which introduce their own issues. Thorium-fueled reactors have also been proposed, though they lack clear overall advantages.</p>

		<h3>What’s at Stake</h3>
	</div>

	<h4>Times have changed</h4>
	<p>The defining force behind U.S. nuclear weapons policy—the Soviet Union—hasn’t existed for over 20 years. In its place are terrorism and other modern conflicts, none of which are solved by nuclear weapons. </br>Despite this, the United States still keeps hundreds of thermonuclear warheads—each many times more destructive than the bomb at Hiroshima—ready to be launched within minutes. This “hair-trigger alert” is a 1950's-era relic, leftover from the days of high-stakes nuclear brinkmanship.</p>
	<h4>But hair-trigger alert is a risky policy to inherit</h4>
	<p>From faulty computer chips to misinterpreted radar signals, human and technical mistakes have caused dozens of safety failures and close calls. An accidental or unauthorized missile launch could kill millions of people—and trigger a Russian launch that could kill many millions more.</p>
	<h4>Taking U.S. weapons off hair-trigger alert would immediately remove this risk</h4>
	<p>It would increase the safety of all Americans while maintaining a strong and credible U.S. defense. It would also encourage Russia to take its missiles off hair-trigger alert.</p>
	<h4>As Commander-in-Chief, President Obama can independently end hair-trigger alert</h4>
	<p>Like George W. Bush before him, he promised he would do so during his campaign. Military officials, politicians, and scientists have called for an end to this absurd and dangerous policy—but it hasn’t happened. </br>You can help. <a href="https://secure3.convio.net/ucs/site/Advocacy?cmd=display&page=UserAction&id=4097&s_src=wac&s_subsrc=website&_ga=1.110645895.341012430.1420825001">Remind the president of his promise</a> to end hair-trigger alert and help keep the nation safe!</p>

		<h3>Solutions for a Safer World</h3>
	</div>

	<p>With the right policy shifts on nuclear weapons, terrorism, and related issues, we can ensure that good science helps keep the United States safe.</p>
	<h4>Remove hair-trigger alert</h4>
	<p>Cold War-era policies shouldn’t determine how we manage nuclear weapons today—especially when those policies create undue risk. Learn more about <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/node/5170">hair-trigger alert</a></p>
	<h4>Change U.S. nuclear weapons policy</h4>
	<p>Hair-trigger alert isn’t the only outdated policy. Significant arms reductions and a “sole use” policy for nuclear weapons will significantly enhance U.S. security. Learn more about <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear_weapons_and_global_security/solutions/us-nuclear-weapons/">nuclear weapons policy</a></p>
	<h4>Prevent nuclear terrorism</h4>
	<p>Some countries “reprocess” used fuel from nuclear power plants, creating material that’s usable in nuclear weapons. Avoiding this unnecessary step both domestically and abroad is crucial for preventing nuclear terrorism.

	<h4>Re-evaluate missile defense</h4>
	<p>U.S. missile defense is expensive, ineffective, and may undermine national security. Not expanding missile defense sites in the United States—and demanding better testing and accountability—will improve U.S. security.

	<h4>Strengthen relations with China</h4>
	<p>Peaceful relationships depend on good information, not political rhetoric or hyperbole. Clearly communicating U.S. and Chinese intentions is essential for maintaining a cooperative relationship.

	<h4>Enhance space security</h4>
	<p>With more satellites in orbit than ever before, avoiding space-based conflicts is a top priority. Smart planning and thoughtful safeguarding—not weaponization—will protect U.S. interests in space.
